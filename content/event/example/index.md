summary: Noboru Isobe will give a contributed presentation in poster format.
abstract: 'The poster discusses a mathematical analysis of a deep neural network model called ODE-Net, where learning is formulated as an optimal control problem. The existence of an optimizer for this problem needs to be assumed to justify the learning, but few studies have analyzed this in detail. We proves the existence of an optimizer when a neural network, which describes a vector field of ODE-Net, is linear with respect to learnable parameters.'
